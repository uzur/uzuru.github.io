## About
This is the source code repository of tomu.name, a site dedicated to digitally publishing Tom Hackshaw's true/untrue stories. It is part of an ongoing art project which explores the nature and idea of telling someone a message, especially on the Internet, and how it may be perceived or believed by the viewer.
