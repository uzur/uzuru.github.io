## About
This is the source code repository of stories.tomhackshaw.com, a site dedicated to digitally publishing people's true/untrue stories, spam and copypastas (with a narrative quality). It is part of an ongoing art project by tom Hackshaw which explores the nature and idea of telling someone a message, especially on the Internet, and how it may be perceived or believed by the viewer.
