This site acts as a digital archive for true/untrue stories, copypastas and spam written by people. It is part of an ongoing art project by Tom Hackshaw which explores the nature and idea of telling someone something. 
<br><br>
To submit stories (true or untrue), contact the author _hi@tomhackshaw.com_ and specify:
<br><br>
* the story itself
<br>
* if you would like credit for your story (otherwise "anonymous")
<br>
* the title
<br>
* any supporting images/documentation

<br>
There is no length limit, so go crazy!
