##Afghan Boy

My father is a journalist who used to be stationed in the Middle East for his assignment over ten years ago. 
<br><br>
He’d call me from time to time and I once asked him <br>
what he’d been up to.<br>
He told me that he’d gone to see a primary school in Afghanistan.
<br><br>
He said to me, <br>
“I was touring the primary school<br>
and when I came across a class of kids your age<br>
I was given me some time to interview them.”
<br><br>
“One of the questions I asked them was,<br>
what they would like to be <br>
when they grew up.”
<br><br>
“And you know,<br>
Afghanistan is an unfortunate country.<br>
It’s been in a war for years and years.<br>
So it was only natural that most of the kids wanted to be<br> 
either soldiers<br>
or doctors<br>
or nurses<br>
to help their people.”
<br><br>
“There was one boy<br>
out of the class of about thirty kids<br>
who wanted to be an artist<br>
and I asked him why.”
<br><br>
“He said, <br>
‘Because pictures <br>
can make people gentle.<br>
If I paint -and I will paint- only nice pictures <br>
people will be nice<br>
and end the war.’”
<br><br>
The nice kind of art is no longer good enough,<br>
at least in societies of the ‘developed’ world.
<br><br>
I wish I could know <br>
if the boy has kept his promise <br>
and paints pictures now.
