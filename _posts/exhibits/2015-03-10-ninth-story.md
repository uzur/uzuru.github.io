## A look into rap music

Rap music:
<br>
-degrades the english language
<br>
-Promotes tagging and vandalism
<br>
-degrades women
<br>
-Implies postivity to primitive force (look at any metal cd, and youll see an imaginative cover with interesting artwork, look at a hip hop Cd, and youll see a pissed off rapper wanting to fight)
<br>
-Shifts values to "bling" and expensive shoes which leads to theft
<br>
-Promotes Rastafrian culture
<br>
Rap can be made by ANYBODY, a preset drum machine is all you need to make primitve music and get signed to a record label. If youve been shot, thats credible and prefered to hype your image, just like growing up on the "street"
<br>
The lyrics are simple, the sentences dont need to be related, just whatever can ryhme is fine. They dont even have to make sense, just as long as it sticks to an even flow. And sometimes, rappers will get lazy and mispronounce words to rhyme.
<br>
Now some of you guys are gonna say "omg racist", but more thn half of all rap music is sold to whites. No other genre of music promotes more negative values than hip hop, and as it spreads toward different regions, it infects the native population like a fungus.
<br>
There is NO talent in rap, so next time, whe your downloading music, get yourself a king crimson, dark tranquility, symphony x or non-hip hop album. Your brain will thank you for not degenerating it into a pile of primtive processing jello
