## There was once a huge hornet's nest...

that had built up underneath a bridge, 
<br>
at the river the kids always used to play around.
<br>
Everyone in the village knew the nest was there; 
<br>
so long as the hornets weren’t disturbed, 
<br>
they weren’t a threat.
<br>
They were Asian Giant Hornets –
<br>
average body length 5cm, 
<br>
and an injection of their venom 
<br>
can be fatal to humans, especially kids.
<br><br>
Kids in this village, in post WWII Japan, 
<br>
used to play games using these hornets. 
<br>
They’d look for the biggest rock
<br>
that they could find in the river bed 
<br>
and throw it at the nest. 
<br>
When the aggravated hornets came after them, 
<br>
they’d race each other into the river 
<br>
and dive in.
<br>
Safe underwater, they’d watch from below the surface 
<br>
as the hornets circled above them.
<br>
This was how they used to pass the time in the summer.
<br><br>
Near this bridge was a cremation site,
<br>
where funeral processions would bring the dead 
<br>
and some buns as offerings. 
<br><br>
Scheming to steal food 
<br>
was another favourite game for these kids; 
<br>
they were always hungry, 
<br>
since post war Japan 
<br>
was poor and food was scarce.
<br><br>
The funeral buns 
<br>
had been one of their biggest goals for a while. 
<br>
They hadn’t been successful due to one problem; 
<br>
It was said
<br>
that the corpse will rise out of the fire and eat them.
<br>
So they came up with a plan to use the hornets 
<br>
to scare away the relatives at the funeral,
<br>
before they set up the fire.
<br><br>
They waited for the next funeral, 
<br>
and one day when a procession came,
<br>
carrying the body,
<br>
and the buns,
<br>
the kids showered the hornet’s nest with stones
<br>
and jumped into the river as usual.
<br><br>
They waited for the swarm to pass
<br>
and head towards the mourning crowd,
<br>
and watched
<br>
with their heads poking out of the water,
<br>
as the people ran and screamed
<br>
in total chaos
<br>
around the cremation site.
<br><br>
When the last of them had gone
<br>
the kids hurried up the river bank
<br>
to the cremation site
<br>
to grab as many buns
<br>
as they could carry.
<br>
They brought them to a nearby field
<br>
where they hid and ate them.
<br><br>
Hungry children are dangerous.
