## The walk to his house...

...is quiet and awkward and it’s almost like they haven’t been doing the same thing over and over again for — a month, now? two months? he doesn’t keep count — a while. The streets are a decrepit gray and illuminated by a march of yellow lights, and the houses on each side of it are all lit up on the inside, little candles contained inside colorfully-painted boxes. Above, the sky is a gloomy, dim shade, but the moon hasn’t yet come out, and he can’t even see the stars with all the clouds hovering heavily up there. The city air is full of pollution, and it’s something he’s never properly appreciated before he met her.
