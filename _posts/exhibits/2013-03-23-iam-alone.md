## 21

Just thinking "this is what I do all day, this is what I will probably be doing for a long time" and the realization that your time is running out at the age of 21. I am not going to die soon, but I feel low as if my life has just been a long crawl and I'm too weak to bear my own weight. My hour glass is just slowly sifting away. The fact that I have all the advantages and opportunities in the world and I am privileged, but I am too incompetent to do anything anyways. Loneliness building and building, layered on top of every day you've been lonely for years and year.
