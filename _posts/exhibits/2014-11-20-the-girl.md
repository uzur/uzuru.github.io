## GIRL

desperate to see this girl I've been in love with for two years
<br>
she lives two and a half hours away
<br>
lie to her and tell her I'm in town and that we should meet
<br>
she surprisingly says that we should
<br>
start throwing all my shit in my car
<br>
tell her I'm "with friends" and that I can see her later tonight
<br>
she agrees to the time
<br>
start driving down the interstate in shock that she agreed
<br>
no music playing the entire time there, just thinking about how nice tonight will be to see her again
<br>
the two hours pass and I'm in her town
<br>
I drive to her apartment
<br>
I find her room and knock on the door
<br>
her roommate I've never met before tells me she's out "with her boyfriend"
<br>
my heart sinks
<br>
I walk back to my car and send her a pathetic text asking "hey are we still on for tonight?"
<br>
no response
<br>
I sit in my car the entire night waiting for her to come back
<br>
she never does
<br>
drive the two and a half hours back home the following morning
<br>
give up on her and never hear from her again
<br>
I dream of her still sometimes though.
