## Damn

Someone had made me a mixtape and given it to me today, without knowing my musical tastes or preferences.
<br>
King Krule was on it holy fuck I was so fucking stoked it was amazing. The rest of the songs were 10/10 taste as well. 
<br>
Why can't I come up with cool art ideas like this?

Sorry for shitposting I know this isn't a blog site.
