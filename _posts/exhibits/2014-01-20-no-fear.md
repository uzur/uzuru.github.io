## No fear 

I find mana in all things maori and vicious.
<br>
Down south in this gully their were maori one side and English on the other. 
<br>
Their was a swamp in the middle of the gully so in order to get a across they had to run straight up the middle chanting a war Haka as they ran straight at them. 
<br>
A lot of brothers died because of the English muskets but the Maori stay strong regardless of how many brothers fell. They then proceeded to stack the brothers up in a huge bridge across the swamp, as more brothers past on they crept slowly towards the other side eventually coming face to face with their enemy. 
<br>
Maori favour close combat and quickly dispatched all who stood before them. 
<br>
Utterly wasted them pretty much. Then they all stood victorious over all the passed on soldiers, looked up to the heavens and prayed to tumatauinga the God of war then feasted on the enemy to gain their fighting prowess
