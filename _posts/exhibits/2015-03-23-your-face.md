## Her

She’d said “Oh god I’m sorry...I mean I like you a lot, but I just don’t feel the same way...I’m so sorry...I should go”.
<br>
And then I don’t really wake up.
<br>
I continue to go on and on and on and the hurt doesn’t go away until you drown it with alcohol, but even then it just comes back with a vengeance later and then she sees me and I haven’t bathed in days and my eyes are bloodshot and I smell like shit and when I see the disappointment in her eyes I realise that maybe, just maybe she had second thoughts about me but now they are dashed, completely fucking gone and the one fucking chance I had at getting myself out of this hole is gone and to cope with the pain I just drink more and go back to the pills to sleep.
