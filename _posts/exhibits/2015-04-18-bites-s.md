##Bites

My dad has these marks these marks
These marks he has on his thighs.
<br><br>
Ever since I was small was small
I’ve been asking 
what they are.
<br><br>
Although he’s been telling me telling
that he got it from a dog bite,
it doesn’t look it, look it to me.
<br><br>
They’re black dots, dots, dots, dots oval shape.
I ask him every chance I get,
but he always gives me the same answer
after every time I question him.
<br><br>
I’ve accepted it as truth as truth
As truth but just this year
I decided to ask him one last time,
one last time I asked him.
“Dad, did you really get those marks 
those marks really from a dog bite?”
<br><br>
Actually it was, he told me then,
that he told me from his first
attempts at tattooing himself
he said
attempts at tattooing himself.
<br><br>

My mum has these marks these marks
These marks on her stomach side.
<br><br>
When I was small I used to ask 
I asked her what they were.
<br><br>
She’d tell me a bite from a wolf it was 
when she hadn’t listened to her parents.
<br><br>
I listened to my mother after that,
For a while I listened to her.
<br><br>
I’d accepted it as truth as truth 
until I was a little older,
when I asked her again, 
asking, “Mum, where did you 
get those marks?”
<br><br>
And she told me, 
terrifyingly,
that from her appendix it was.
