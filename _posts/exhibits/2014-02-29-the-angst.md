## Fuck it

I can't feel anymore. I can't get excited anymore. The only feels I get are to be happy or sad, and sometimes its always nothing.
<br>

My friends don't know, any they won't help or anything. Most likely they'll give me bullshit advice. I'm too pussy to even commit suicide. I don't get the urge to self harm like how I used to, fuck, I must've been more manly back then. I didn't go across with my cuts, always down my arm in hope of hitting a fucking vein.
<br>

I don't want sympathy, I don't wish for advice. I want something to live for. I'm fucking useless for everything I do.<br><br>
