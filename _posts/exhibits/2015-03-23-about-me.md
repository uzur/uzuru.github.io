## My youth
<img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7407/16238183620_64d6757b38.jpg" >

I grew up in a really small town and around the middle of high school I got into drugs and I went from being a straight A student to a dropout. I fucked up my life and my family's reputation. Everyone knew I was an addict. I wasn't going anywhere. I recently (two years ago) left. I decided to quit feeling sorry for myself and stop leeching off of my parents. They were done with me by that point anyway. I've been clean for a while and I've been able to keep a steady job. I've even made a few friends. Things aren't great, but my life has made a 360 turn around. And parasite just reminds me of the time in my life before that and I don't want to go back.
